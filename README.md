# Dext Framework - Modern Full-Stack Development for Delphi

> ⚠️ **Status: Beta (v1.0 Preview)**
> > The project has reached the Beta milestone. Core APIs are stable, but minor breaking changes might still occur before the final v1.0 release.
>
> 📌 **Check out the [V1.0 Beta Roadmap & Plan](Docs/Releases/v1-beta-roadmap.md)** for a detailed list of features, pending tasks, and future plans.

**Dext** is a complete ecosystem for modern Delphi development. It brings the productivity and architectural patterns of frameworks like **ASP.NET Core** and **Spring Boot** to the native performance of Object Pascal.

The goal is not merely to build APIs, but to provide a solid foundation (DI, Configuration, Logging, ORM) enabling you to build robust and testable enterprise applications.

## 🎯 Philosophy and Goals

*   **Parity with .NET Core**: The primary goal is to reach feature parity with equivalent frameworks in the .NET ecosystem (ASP.NET Core, EF Core), staying up-to-date with platform innovations.
*   **Native Performance**: After functional stabilization of v1, the focus will shift entirely to **performance optimization**, aiming to compete with high-speed frameworks.
*   **Innovation**: While inspired by .NET, Dext is not limited to it, seeking to implement solutions that specifically make sense for the Delphi language.

## 📄 License

This project is licensed under the **Apache License 2.0** (the same used by .NET Core). This allows free use in commercial and open-source projects, with the security of a permissive and modern license.

## 🧠 Design & Philosophy

Dext's development is guided by two engineering principles that define every architectural decision made in the project:

> **"Simplicity is Complicated."** — *Rob Pike*

Hiding the complexity of HTTP servers, memory management, and concurrency requires sophisticated internal engineering. We embrace this internal complexity to ensure that your public API is **clean, intuitive, and noise-free**.

* **In practice:** You write `App.MapGet`, and the framework quietly resolves routing, JSON serialization, and error handling.

> **"Make what is right easy and what is wrong difficult."** — *Steve "Ardalis" Smith*

A good framework should guide the developer into the "Pit of Success". Dext was designed so that best practices—such as Dependency Injection, interface segregation, and using DTOs—are the natural default, not a burdensome extra configuration.

## 🚀 Main Modules

### 🌐 Dext.Web (Web Framework)
A lightweight and powerful HTTP framework for building REST APIs and microservices.
- **Minimal APIs**: Concise fluent syntax for route definition.
- **Controllers**: Traditional class-based support for complex APIs.
- **Smart Binding**: Automatic JSON serialization and validation for Records/Classes.
- **Middlewares**: Modular and extensible request pipeline.
- **SSL/HTTPS**: Pluggable support for OpenSSL and TaurusTLS (OpenSSL 1.1x/3.x).
- **First-Class UUID**: Native support for binding `TUUID` (RFC 9562) in Routes/Body.
- **Multipart/Form-Data**: Native support for file uploads via `IFormFile`.
- **Response Compression**: Built-in GZip compression middleware.
- **Cookies**: Full support for reading and writing cookies with `TCookieOptions`.
- **OpenAPI**: Native Swagger integration with auto-generated documentation.
- **Database as API**: Zero-code REST endpoints from entities with `TDataApiHandler<T>.Map` - includes filtering, pagination, and security policies.

### 🗄️ Dext.Entity (ORM)
A modern ORM focused on productivity and performance.
- **Code-First**: Define your database using Delphi classes.
- **Scaffolding**: Database-First support to generate entities from existing schemas.
- **Migrations**: Database schema version control (`migrate:up`, `migrate:down`, `migrate:generate`).
- **Fluent Query API**: Strongly typed and expressive queries.
- **Smart Properties**: Type-safe query expressions without magic strings. Write `u.Age > 18` and get compile-time checks, IntelliSense, and automatic SQL generation. [Learn more](Docs/smart-properties.md)
- **Change Tracking**: Automatic change tracking and optimized persistence.
- **Advanced Types**: Native support for **UUID v7** (Time-Ordered), JSON/JSONB, and Arrays.
- **Multi-Tenancy**:
  - **Shared Database**: Automatic filtering by `TenantId`.
  - **Schema-based Isolation**: High-performance isolation via schemas (PostgreSQL `search_path`, SQL Server prefixing).
  - **Tenant per Database**: Dynamic connection string resolution based on tenant.
  - **Automatic Schema Creation**: `EnsureCreated` automatically sets up per-tenant schemas.
- **Inheritance Mapping**:
  - **Table-Per-Hierarchy (TPH)**: Full support for base classes and subclasses in a single table.
  - **Polymorphic Hydration**: Automatic instantiation of the correct subclass during data retrieval.
  - **Attribute-based Mapping**: Use `[Inheritance]`, `[DiscriminatorColumn]`, and `[DiscriminatorValue]`.
- **Multi-Database**: Support for SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Firebird, MySQL, Oracle, and SQLite.
- **High-Performance Drivers**:
  - **Standard FireDAC Driver**: Full-featured with TDataSet compatibility
  - **FireDAC Phys Driver**: "Bare metal" access bypassing TDataSet for maximum performance
  - Direct access to FireDAC's physical layer (IFDPhysConnection) for ultra-fast queries
- **Performance**: High-Speed Metadata Cache (singleton-based) to minimize reflection overhead.

### ⚙️ Dext.Core (Infrastructure)
The foundation of the framework, usable in any type of application.
- **Dependency Injection**: Full and fast IOC container.
- **Configuration**: Flexible configuration system (JSON, Environment Variables).
- **Logging**: Structured logging abstraction.
- **Async/Await**: Primitives for real asynchronous programming.
- **Collections**: Advanced generic collections with functional extensions.
- **Specifications**: Business rule encapsulation and composition (DDD).
- **Expressions**: Expression tree primitives for dynamic logic evaluation.
- **JSON Serialization**:
  - **High-Performance UTF-8**: Direct UTF-8 serialization/deserialization without intermediate string conversions
  - **Zero-Copy Parsing**: Optimized for minimal memory allocations
  - **Smart Type Support**: Native handling of GUID, Enums, DateTime, and custom types
  - **Pluggable Drivers**: Support for JsonDataObjects (default) and System.JSON

- **Indy**: Uses Indy components (already included in Delphi) for the HTTP transport layer (subject to future replacement/optimization).

## 📦 Installation and Configuration

> 📖 **Detailed Guide**: For a complete step-by-step walkthrough, please read the [Installation Guide](Docs/Installation.md).

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dext-framework/dext.git
   ```

   > 📦 **Package Note**: The project is organized into modular packages located in the `Sources` directory (e.g., `Dext.Core.dpk`, `Dext.Web.Core.dpk`, `Dext.Data.dpk`). You can open `Sources/DextFramework.groupproj` to load all packages at once.

2. **Configure Paths in Delphi:**
   Add the following paths to your **Library Path** (for compilation) and **Browsing Path** (for code navigation):
   - `\Sources\Core`
   - `\Sources\Data`
   - `\Sources\Expressions`
   - `\Sources\Hosting`
   - `\Sources\Http`
   - `\Sources\Testing`

   > 📝 **Note**: Compiled files (`.dcu`, binaries) will be generated in the `.\Output` directory.


3. **Dependencies:**
   - The framework uses `FastMM5` (recommended for memory debugging).
   - Native database drivers (FireDAC, etc.) are supported.

## ⚡ Quick Example (Minimal API)

```pascal
program MyAPI;

uses
  Dext.Web;

begin
  var App := TDextApplication.Create;
  var Builder := App.Builder;

  // Simple Route
  Builder.MapGet<IResult>('/hello', 
    function: IResult
    begin
      Result := Results.Ok('{"message": "Hello Dext!"}');
    end);

  // Route with parameter and binding
  Builder.MapGet<Integer, IResult>('/users/{id}',
    function(Id: Integer): IResult
    begin
      Result := Results.Json(Format('{"userId": %d}', [Id]));
    end);

  App.Run(8080);
end.
```

## 🧩 Model Binding & Dependency Injection

Dext automatically resolves dependencies and deserializes JSON bodies into Records/Classes:

```pascal
// 1. Register Services
App.Services.AddSingleton<IEmailService, TEmailService>;

// 2. Define Endpoint with Dependencies
// - 'Dto': Automatically bound from JSON Body (Smart Binding)
// - 'EmailService': Automatically injected from DI Container
App.Builder.MapPost<TUserDto, IEmailService, IResult>('/register',
  function(Dto: TUserDto; EmailService: IEmailService): IResult
  begin
    EmailService.SendWelcome(Dto.Email);
    Result := Results.Created('/login', 'User registered');
  end);
```

## 💎 ORM Example (Fluent Query)

Dext ORM allows expressive and strongly typed queries, eliminating magical SQL strings:

```pascal
// Complex Query with Joins and Filters
// O: TOrder (Alias/Proxy)
var Orders := DbContext.Orders
  .Where((O.Status = TOrderStatus.Paid) and (O.Total > 1000))
  .Include('Customer') // Eager Loading
  .Include('Items')
  .OrderBy(O.Date.Desc)
  .Take(50)
  .ToList;

// High-Performance Bulk Update
DbContext.Products
  .Where(P.Category = 'Outdated') // P: TProduct
  .Update                         // Starts bulk update
  .Execute;
```

## ⚡ Async Example (Fluent Tasks)

Forget `TThread` complexity. Use a modern API based on Promises/Tasks:

```pascal
// Asynchronous Task Chaining
var Task := TAsyncTask.Run<TUserProfile>(
  function: TUserProfile
  begin
    // Runs on background
    Result := ExternalApi.GetUserProfile(UserId);
  end)
  .ThenBy<Boolean>(
    function(Profile: TUserProfile): Boolean
    begin
      Result := Profile.IsVerified and Profile.HasCredit;
    end)
  .OnComplete( // Returns to UI Thread automatically
    procedure(IsVerified: Boolean)
    begin
      if IsVerified then
        ShowSuccess('User Verified!')
      else
        ShowError('Verification Failed');
    end)
  .Start; // Starts execution

// Timeout & Cancellation Handling
var CTS := TCancellationTokenSource.Create;

TAsyncTask.Run<TReport>(
  function: TReport
  begin
    // Pass token to long-running operation
    Result := ReportService.GenerateHeavyReport(CTS.Token);
  end)
  .WithCancellation(CTS.Token) // Links token to Task pipeline
  .OnComplete(
    procedure(Report: TReport)
    begin
      ShowReport(Report);
    end)
  .OnException(
    procedure(Ex: Exception)
    begin
      if Ex is EOperationCancelled then
        ShowMessage('Operation timed out!')
      else
        ShowError(Ex.Message);
    end)
  .Start;
```
